# Developer-portfolio

## About
Hello! My name is Mariia and this is my first attempt to create a developer's portfolio page from scratch. Right now it is similar with mockup but with different colors. Very soon I will create my new portfolio with some Frameworks, my photo and add there my new projects. 

**Note:** I tried to create a portfolio without the use of JS so to get to project you will need to click on title not card.

[Portfolio deployed version](https://maryvpie.github.io/mv-pirogova-portfolio/)

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Screenshots and mockups of the page
